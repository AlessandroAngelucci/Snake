# Snake
Snake is a sub-genre of action video games where the player manoeuvres the end of a growing line, often themed as a snake. The player must keep the snake from colliding with itself and with the screen's boarders, which gets harder as the snake lengthens.
It originated in 1976 as a two-player arcade game where the goal was to survive longer than the other player.
The concept evolved into a single-player variant where a snake gets longer with each piece of food eaten.
